**The H4 / 120-cell defect improvement — honest CONDITIONAL combinator.**

Sequel to `Wall260_ClayReduction` (the general pointwise dependence-defect
reduction with threshold `log(7·C)`). Where Wall260 pins the ℤ⁴ link incidence
`C = 6` (threshold `log 42`), this wall records the H4 / 120-cell improvement:
the second-largest adjacency eigenvalue of the relevant H4 graph is the golden
ratio `λ₂ = φ`, so the improved dependence constant is `C = 1 + φ = φ² ≈ 2.618`
and the defect drops to `Defect ≤ log(1+φ) − ε`, with the margin `ε > 0` coming
from the ℤ⁴-vs-H4 graph comparison. Threshold drops to `log(7·(1+φ)) ≈ log 18.33
< log 42`.

The golden ratio is `φ := (1 + √5)/2`; `1 + φ = φ²` is the genuine golden-ratio
identity.

WHAT IS GENUINE / UNCONDITIONAL (classical trio, no `sorry`):
* `phi_pos` — `0 < φ`.
* `phi_sq_eq` — `φ² = φ + 1`, i.e. `1 + φ = φ²` (the golden-ratio identity, the
  reason `1 + φ` is the special H4 constant).
* `one_add_phi_lt_six` — `1 + φ < 6`: the H4 constant is strictly smaller than the
  ℤ⁴ link incidence.
* `graph_gap_pos` — `0 < log 6 − log(1+φ)`: the ℤ⁴-vs-H4 constant comparison
  yields a STRICTLY POSITIVE gap (the honest realization that "ε > 0 comes from
  the graph comparison" — a positive margin exists).
* `h4_threshold_lt_z4` — `log(7·(1+φ)) < log 42`: the H4 KP threshold strictly
  undercuts the ℤ⁴ threshold.

WHAT IS CONDITIONAL (named-open hypotheses — the "h_rate mechanism": a hypothesis,
NOT a Lean `axiom`):
* `h4_defect_beats_z4` — from the NAMED OPEN H4 defect bound
  `h_graph : Defect ≤ log(1+φ) − ε` with `ε > 0`, conclude `Defect < log 6`: the
  H4 graph comparison strictly beats the ℤ⁴ defect bound.
* `h4_clay_reduction` — feeds the H4 defect bound `∀ x, I_E x − I_polymer x ≤
  log(1+φ) − ε` and the H4-threshold rate `h_rate : ∀ x, log(7·(1+φ)) < I_E x`
  through `Wall260.new_clay_reduction` (at `C = 1+φ`) to conclude
  `∀ x, log 7 < I_polymer x`.

## Honest scope (locked)

* **This does NOT prove the real H4 spectral gap `λ₂ = φ`.** That is a statement
  about the adjacency spectrum of the 120-cell / H4 Coxeter graph, which is NOT in
  mathlib v4.12.0 and is not constructed here. `φ` enters here ONLY as the real
  number `(1+√5)/2`; the claim that it IS the H4 second eigenvalue is OUTSIDE this
  file.
* **This does NOT prove the real dependence defect bound.** `Defect` is an
  abstract real scalar and the H4 defect bound `Defect ≤ log(1+φ) − ε` is a NAMED
  OPEN hypothesis (the genuine cluster-expansion / Dobrushin-uniqueness input
  refined by the graph comparison), NOT a Lean `axiom` and NOT `by sorry` — so
  `#print axioms` shows no new axioms. It is proved NOWHERE here. The genuine
  positive-gap content delivered is `graph_gap_pos` (the CONSTANT comparison
  `log 6 vs log(1+φ)`), not the spectral gap and not the defect bound.
* **This is a REDUCTION/IMPROVEMENT, not a proof.** It proves NO part of the Clay
  Yang–Mills problem, discharges NO open surface, constructs NO real SU(N) rate
  functional (`I_E`, `I_polymer` abstract). Makes NO mass-gap / `μ > 0` /
  Surface-#1 / RH / BSD claim, and does NOT touch the invariant-locked
  `kotecky_preiss_criterion` `sorry`. YM stays `Status: Open`.

## Axiom footprint
Classical trio `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` only. No `sorry`,
no `sorryAx`, no new axioms. Imports `Towers.YM.Wall260_ClayReduction` and
`Mathlib.Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Log.Basic` (for `Real.log` monotonicity).
